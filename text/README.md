## Hi!

Welcome to a book that follows the path of the author learning a new programming
language, Rust. It's not quite a tutorial, although I'm hoping it will end up
being useful to others learning Rust too.

The text is more a lab notebook. I'll try to document what I'm trying to achieve
at each step and then make.

This text should not be considered the work of a long-term Rust programmer.
I am a competent Python developer who is broadening one's skills and
any mistakes that I make in the process should be seen as such.  


## We'll be implementing GNU `coreutils`

The GNU project has developed a set of really neat utilities that are probably
present &ndash; as themselves or as clones &ndash; in some device that you've
touched today.

I'm hoping that they will be a good set of things to attempt to replicate.
Each utility is often quite straightforward, they're well understood and
yet they touch upon many areas that should enable me to experiment with lots of
interesting language features I'm sure.

The other thing of course is that there are already several implementations of
each of the utilities within `coreutils`. That means there will be a few places
to refer to if I get stuck.

One of the downsides of this approach is that the testing infrastructure is a
little awkward. I'll need to test each utility from the outside. I'm sure I'll
learn how do do that over time, but right now I'm not too sure.
