# notcoreutils

Learn Rust by needlessly implementing GNU `coreutils`

## About

This text is intended as a bit of a choose your own adventure walkthrough of the Rust
programming language. There are (well, will be) dozens of small projects in here
that explore different parts of the language. By project two, we already touch
upon one of Rust's specialties: conditional compilation depending on which
operating system we're dealing with.

If you're not sure what conditional compilation might mean, don't let that scare
you off though. We start easy and all of the projects are well documented.

This book is written by a Python programmer learning Rust. That means that
it's unlikely that you'll find perfectly idiomatic code. Still, I hope you find
reading worthwhile. If you find something that should be improved, you are
very welcome to submit a pull request to get it fixed!


## Reading

The easiest way to read this text is by clicking through the `text` directory.
The reading order is available in `text/SUMMARY.md`.

At some stage &ndash; when there's a little more content &ndash I'll get a
rendered book online.


## Building

You will need `rustbook` to build the HTML. The easiest way is to clone
